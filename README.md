# Software Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Software Engineering Portfolio! This repository showcases my work in the software engineering domain, including code, projects, and relevant documentation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **_data/**: Contains personal information and configuration files for the website.
- **_includes/** and **_layouts/**: Stores the template code used for rendering the portfolio pages.
